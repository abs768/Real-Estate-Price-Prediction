# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

This a simple DataScience developed by me inorder to understand how a real life machine learning model works and with the help of flask and various frontend frameworks how can I actually
showcase my results by actually crreating a simple website.

Here in this I have used:
1) Basic Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for Data Cleaning
3) Matplotlib for Data Visualization
4) Scikit Learn for model building
5) vscode,pycharm, jupyternotebook being used as IDE
6) python flask for http server
7)HTML,CSS,JavaScript for UI
